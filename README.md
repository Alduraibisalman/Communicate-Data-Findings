# Communicate-Data-Findings

## Dataset

The data set contains information about 5K movies collected from The Movie Database (IMDb), including user ratings and score.I would like to find other intresting patterns in the dataset.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that in 2002 is the highest movie release. The most duration of the movie 
between 95 to 100 mins. Most of the movies are R and PG-13 rated. Universal Pictures release more then 
300 movies which is the hgiest company making movie. I found a
somewhat surprising result which is the highest movie genre is Comedy I thought the Action movie is the highest.
Avatar movie has the highest gross earn comparing with the budget. For Writer Nicolas Cage has 40 Movies which is the highest number. For Dirctor Woody Allen is the top diroctor which has 33 Movies.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the Genre, Duration of the movie and the top company of making movie. 
I start with the Genre, followed by the Duration, then Top Company. I use the countplot of genre. For movie Duration I use Violinplot to be clear in which duration are the highest. Then I use Subplots for the top company.
